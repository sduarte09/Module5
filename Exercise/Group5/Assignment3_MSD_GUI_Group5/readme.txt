The Back water curve (BWC) GUI model name is "bwc_v2_G5.py" and working fine with implicit as well as explicit numerical methods. First provide input data by clicking Geometry, Physical and Hydro Parameters or accept their default values by clicking "OK" button which will appear along with data input boxes. Then do "Calculate / Show Results". Remember to click Back Water Curve Option otherwise you may not get output.

The Sugawara Tank Model is also working well with GUI file name of "Sugawara_GUI_G5.py". Other file names "output.asc", "sugawara.py" and "sugawara.png" are required to be in the same current folder of sugawara python file (Sugawara_GUI_G5.py).

The above two GUI models are working nicely. However, when it was tried to combine both models to have button options active then the combined code was giving some callback and other errors (same code in individual model python files is nicely working).
